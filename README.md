This system is called "Nix sos"
Hi This is a thread to the result of my struggle for better code as a result of this there are several files that should make it easier to install nixhost.
The Nix sos system which is in the nixsos folder it has been upgraded from 19 to 21 and renamed to "Nix host" system.
The mnton.sh file must be modified to match the disk system for the host or computer. All drives and mount points are fictitious and can be replaced.
