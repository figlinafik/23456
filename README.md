This system is called "Nix sos"
Hi This is a thread to the result of my struggle for better code as a result of this there are several files that should make it easier to install nixhost.
The mnton.sh file must be modified to match the disk system for the host or computer. All drives and mount points are fictitious and can be replaced.
The Nix sos system was the first system to be modified from 19 to 21 renamed to "Nix tail" system
