This is the configuration file "nixsos" "19.09".
Name "nixhost" version "21.05".
Transferring the configuration of old files to the new "nixhost" system.
I decided not to carry over the lines of code. In the config file "nixhost" and rewrite "nixsos" "19.09".
According to the new configuration.
It's just that the system was based on "KDE" and its settings. Now I want to install "gnome" according to these settings.
